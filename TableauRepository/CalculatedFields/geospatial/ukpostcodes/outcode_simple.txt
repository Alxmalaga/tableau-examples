# Takes a UK postcode (eg 'NW1 8TQ') and returns the first part of the postcode ('NW1')
# known as the outcode, thereby performing a degree of geographical aggregation.
# Assumes that the input postcode is formatted with a space after
# the outcode. Could be generalised to a regex to work with out the space, by pattern
# matching on the start of the incode which is always an integer.
