// Based on http://www.theinformationlab.co.uk/2013/01/14/maintaining-percent-of-total-whilst-filtering/

// Create a duplicate data set called Totals. Then in the original
// dataset create a calculated filed caled '% of totals'.
// This allows to calculate percentages as a function of the total

SUM([Number of Records])/SUM([Totals].[Number of Records]) * 100.
